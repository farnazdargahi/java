## Course description
This course is an intermediate-level study of the Java programming language. Topics include single and
multidimensional arrays; objects and classes; object-oriented programming; inheritance and
polymorphism; exception handling and text input/output (I/O); abstract classes and interfaces; graphical
user interfaces (GUIs); recursion; concurrency; and generic collections and data structures, such as
linked lists, queues, and stacks. This course is intended for students majoring in computer and
information sciences or anyone interested in learning more about the Java programming language.

## Student learning outcomes

- Apply algorithmic and mathematical reasoning to solve a wide range of computational problems.
- Analyze and evaluate alternative solutions to computing problems using a programming language.
- Use current tools in computing practice such as Integrated Development Environments and Code Sharing platforms.
