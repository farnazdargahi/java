# Java Class Exercise: Grade Analyzer

## Objective

Write a Java program that:

- Accepts grades for a group of students  
- Passes the array of grades to a method  
- That method calculates and prints:
  - Average grade  
  - Highest grade  
  - Number of failing grades (below 65)  

---

## Instructions

1. In `main`, ask the user for the number of students.
2. Create an array to store grades.
3. Use a loop to get each grade from the user.
4. Pass the array to a method called `analyzeGrades(int[] grades)`.
5. In that method:
   - Calculate average  
   - Find highest grade  
   - Count failing grades (`grade < 65`)  
   - Print the results
